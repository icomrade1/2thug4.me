2thug4.me is a scare-mongering website. Acting like an ip-grabber, it shows the user their ip, along with some other information.
although they aren't actually stored anywhere and are just there only to scare the user.
You can click the background for the music to play.

There's also an embed thug video that could be seen if you post the link on, for example, a discord channel.
